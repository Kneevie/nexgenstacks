                </header>
                <p>The average adult human brain contains approximately 100 billion<a href="sources.html"><sup>[24]</sup></a> neurons, or “brain cells”. Neurons are electrically excitable cells that possess and transmit information to other neurons using electrical and chemical signals via structures termed synapses.  It is believed that there are as many as 100 trillion synaptic connections between neurons within the brain.<a href="sources.html"><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>
                <p>Scientific research indicates that memories are encoded by modification of synaptic strength between neurons in the brain.<a href="sources.html"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The ability of chemical synapses to change their strength is referred to as synaptic plasticity. The degree to which the synapses are strengthened correlates to the strength of the memory itself.</p>
                <p>Patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons result in a phenomenon termed Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), a persistent strengthening of synapses.<a href="sources.html"><sup>[12]</sup></a> LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory.<a href="sources.html"><sup>[11][12]</sup></a></p>
                <p>A cyclic nucleotide, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is produced during the process of LTP.<a href="sources.html"><sup>[18][19]</sup></a> In the absence of cAMP, LTP cannot occur. Brain Seed™ contains Forskolin, which is the only natural supplement that is known and has been shown to increase intracellular levels of cAMP.<a href="sources.html"><sup>[4][5][6][7][8][9]</sup></a></p>
                <p>An enzyme within the brain, phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), breaks down cAMP through a process known as hydrolysis. Brain Seed contains Zembrin®, a powerful PDE4 inhibitor which prolongs the presence of cAMP by inhibition of its degradation by PDE4.</p>
                <p>In summary, Brain Seed facilitates LTP by both increasing intracellular cAMP levels while also inhibiting the breakdown of cAMP by inhibiting PDE4</p>
